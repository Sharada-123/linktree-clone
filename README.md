                    This is a Linktree clone built in React with a clean UI and smooth animations. It includes standard link buttons, foldouts, and headers—all mobile-friendly by design.
                    <br><br>
                    The color palette is customizable via the <code>globals.css</code> file. It also uses the <code>react-icons</code> library, offering access to a vast range of icons.
                    <br><br>
                    Each element (link button, foldout, and social icon) comes with per-element settings, so you can fine-tune the appearance and behavior as needed.

                    This was my first React project—built primarily as a learning experience.
