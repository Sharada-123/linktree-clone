    This is a Linktree clone built in React with a clean UI and smooth animations. It includes standard link buttons, foldouts, and headersâ€”all mobile-friendly by design.
    <br><br>
    The color palette is customizable via the <code>globals.css</code> file. It also uses the <code>react-icons</code> library, offering access to a vast range of icons.
    Each element (link button, foldout, and social icon) comes with per-element settings, so you can fine-tune the appearance and behavior as needed.

> If you want to use this, just clone the repository like normal and remove, or change, the `base` config in `vite.config.ts`, the /linktree-clone/ is a specific `base` to my web page.
